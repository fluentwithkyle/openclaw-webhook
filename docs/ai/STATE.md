# Current AI Project State

**Last Updated**: 2026-09-12
**Updated By**: Kilo (implementation of persistent AI project state system)

---

## Project Status: ACTIVE

**Repository**: `fluentwithkyle/openclaw-webhook`
**Default Branch**: `main`
**Production Deployment**: Render (Node.js/Express webhook listener)
**Google Adapter**: Google Apps Script (versioned in `google-apps-script/`)

---

## Active Tasks

| Task | Status | Owner | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|-------|
| Persistent AI project state system | **IN PROGRESS** | Kilo | Creating `docs/ai/` directory and files; updating `AGENTS.md` |
| Apps Script authentication hardening | **BACKLOG** | — | Require shared secret for Node → Apps Script action boundary |
| Abandoned-booking idempotency | **BACKLOG** | — | Durable duplicate-alert prevention needed |
| Webhook signature verification | **BACKLOG** | — | Tally / Cal.com event-ID deduplication |
| Email template ownership migration | **BACKLOG** | — | Move template selection to Render, retain Gmail delivery in Apps Script |
| Automated testing infrastructure | **BACKLOG** | — | Tests, fixtures, contract tests, formal test script |

---

## Current Blockers

1. **Apps Script trust boundary** — Anonymous web app endpoint accepts CRM writes and Gmail delivery without application-level authentication. Hardening required before other reliability work.
2. **No automated test suite** — Changes verified by manual review only.
3. **Legacy abandoned-booking code** — `google-apps-script/AbandonedBookings.js` exists but architectural status unclear; needs deployment verification before retirement.

---

## Upcoming / Backlog Items

### High Priority (Post-Hardening)
- Implement shared-secret authentication for Node → Apps Script boundary
- Add idempotency keys to abandoned-booking workflow
- Standardize Apps Script response handling

### Medium Priority
- Complete webhook signature verification for Tally and Cal.com
- Resolve duplicate `sendClientEmail` in Code.js and Email.js
- Build automated testing infrastructure

### Lower Priority / Architectural
- LINE-centered AI operating model (PROPOSED / TARGET)
- Qwen Router implementation (UNDER VALIDATION)
- Security AI lane definition (PROPOSED / TARGET)
- Utility AI lane definition (PROPOSED / TARGET)
- ACP protocol implementation (PROPOSED / TARGET)

## Agent Roles (Current)

| Role | Agent | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Director / Final Authority | Kyle | **ACTIVE** |
| Primary Builder / Implementer / Tester | Kilo | **ACTIVE** |
| Architect / Planner / Reviewer | Gemini | **ACTIVE** |
| Router | Qwen | **PLANNED** (UNDER VALIDATION) |
| Security Specialist | — | **PROPOSED** |
| Utility Specialist | — | **PROPOSED** |
| Orchestrator (optional) | OpenClaw | **PROPOSED** |

---

## Key Architectural Boundaries (Current)

- **Render / Node.js**: Business decisions, lifecycle logic, webhook processing, workflow orchestration, CRM decisions, notification content
- **Google Apps Script**: Google-specific execution (Sheets reads/writes, Gmail delivery)
- **GitHub Actions**: NOT production server; ephemeral AI execution plane only (PROPOSED / TARGET)
- **LINE**: Communication/notification channel only (not business-rules engine)

## Verification Requirements for Current Work

- `git status --short --branch` — only intended files changed
- `git diff --check` — no whitespace errors
- No secrets in new documentation
- `AGENTS.md` clearly references `docs/ai/` system
- Distinction between CURRENT/IMPLEMENTED and PROPOSED/TARGET maintained
