## 2026-09-12 | Implement Persistent AI Project State System

**Task**: Create `docs/ai/` project-state system and integrate into `AGENTS.md` per Gemini's approved design (Issue #26).

**Summary**: 
- Created `docs/ai/` directory with four files:
  - `README.md` — Operating instructions for the AI project-state system (when to read, file purposes, update rules, security requirements, authoritative vs historical distinctions)
  - `STATE.md` — Current live project state (status, active tasks, blockers, backlog, agent roles, repository structure, architectural boundaries)
  - `ARCH_DECISIONS.md` — 12 architectural decision records (ADR-001 through ADR-012) covering Render/Apps Script boundary, CRM choice, abandoned-booking migration, Apps Script hardening, AI specialist lanes, persistent state system, LINE role, GitHub Actions role, secrets policy, Qwen validation, OpenClaw independence, failover safety
  - `TASK_LOG.md` — This append-only historical log (initialized with this entry)
- Updated `AGENTS.md` to explicitly document `docs/ai/` existence and establish that agents must consult it before planning work
- Populated all files with current verified project context from existing repository documentation and implementation
- Distinguished CURRENT/IMPLEMENTED from PROPOSED/TARGET throughout
- Preserved existing agent roles: Kyle (Director), Kilo (Builder/Implementer/Tester), Gemini (Architect/Reviewer), Qwen (planned Router), OpenClaw (optional), no backup agent
- No secrets, credentials, or sensitive production values included

**Outcome**: SUCCESS — System created, integrated, and populated with verified context.

**Commit Reference**: `5894d6b`
